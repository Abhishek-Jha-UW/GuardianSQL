### 🛡️ GuardianSQL: Automated Data Quality Auditor

**GuardianSQL** is a pro-active data governance tool built to ensure datasets are "Decision-Ready." While standard exploratory data analysis (EDA) focuses on trends, GuardianSQL focuses on **Integrity**, identifying risks before they reach the dashboard.

**Key Value Proposition**
In my experience managing $9M+ business segments, I realized that bad data leads to bad decisions. I built this tool to automate the **C.C.U.V.A.T.** framework, reducing the time spent on manual data profiling by more than 40%.

**The C.C.U.V.A.T. Framework**
The auditor evaluates data across six critical dimensions:
*   **Completeness:** Detects NULLs/missing data.
*   **Consistency:** Logic checks across sets.
*   **Uniqueness:** Flags KPI-skewing duplicates.
*   **Validity:** Format & range validation.
*   **Accuracy:** Outlier/entry error detection.
*   **Timeliness:** Data freshness tracking.

**Impact**
- **Automated Health Scoring:** Provides a 0-100% "Trust Score" for any uploaded CSV/SQL table.
- **Stakeholder Ready:** Generates visual reports that non-technical managers can understand.
- **Scalable:** Built with modular Python classes for easy integration into existing ETL pipelines.
