### 🛡️ GuardianSQL: Automated Data Quality Auditor

**GuardianSQL** is a pro-active data governance tool built to ensure datasets are "Decision-Ready." While standard exploratory data analysis (EDA) focuses on trends, GuardianSQL focuses on **Integrity**, identifying risks before they reach the dashboard.

#### Key Value Proposition
In my experience managing $9M+ business segments, I realized that bad data leads to bad decisions. I built this tool to automate the **C.C.U.V.A.T.** framework, reducing the time spent on manual data profiling by more than 40%.

#### The C.C.U.V.A.T. Framework
The auditor evaluates data across six critical dimensions:
- **C**ompleteness: Detects missing values and NULL distributions.
- **C**onsistency: Ensures logic holds across the dataset.
- **U**niqueness: Flags duplicate records that skew KPIs.
- **V**alidity: Validates formats (emails, dates) and business ranges (prices > 0).
- **A**ccuracy: Identifies statistical outliers that may indicate data entry errors.
- **T**imeliness: Measures data "freshness" based on timestamps.


#### Impact
- **Automated Health Scoring:** Provides a 0-100% "Trust Score" for any uploaded CSV/SQL table.
- **Stakeholder Ready:** Generates visual reports that non-technical managers can understand.
- **Scalable:** Built with modular Python classes for easy integration into existing ETL pipelines.
